### 1. Parsing: Source Code -> AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)

```
    The Scala compiler parses source code and constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), representing the structure of the code.
    Example:

    object X {
      def f(x: Boolean): Boolean = !x
    }
```

### 2. Name Resolution: AST -> AST with Fully Qualified Names

```
    The compiler resolves identifiers and symbols, assigning fully qualified names to methods, types, and objects.
    Example:

    object X {
      def X.f(x: scala.Boolean): scala.Boolean = scala.Predef.![x]
    }
```

### 3. Type Checking and Type Inference: AST -> Typed AST

```
    The compiler infers and verifies types, using both explicit type annotations and inferred types.
    Example:

    object X {
      def X.f(x: scala.Boolean): scala.Boolean = scala.Predef.![x]
    }
```

### 4. Desugaring and Syntactic Transformations: Typed AST -> Simplified AST

```
    The compiler simplifies syntactic sugar constructs. For example, pattern matching, for comprehensions, and lambdas are expanded into simpler forms.
    Example after desugaring:

    object X {
      def X.f(x: scala.Boolean): scala.Boolean = x match {
        case scala.Boolean(true) => false
        case scala.Boolean(false) => true
      }
    }
```

### 5. Optimization: Simplified AST -> Optimized AST

```
    The compiler applies optimizations to the AST, such as inlining, constant folding, and dead code elimination.
    Example after optimization:

    object X {
      def X.f(x: scala.Boolean): scala.Boolean = !x
    }
```

### 6. Transformation to TASTY: AST -> TASTY (Typed Abstract Syntax Trees)

```
    The Typed Abstract Syntax Tree (TASTy) format is generated, which captures the code's semantics in a form that can be serialized and reused.
    TASTy is used by tools like dotc for incremental compilation and macro expansions.
```

### 7. Lowering to JVM Bytecode (JVM Code Generation): TASTY -> Bytecode

```
    The compiler lowers the TASTy representation to JVM bytecode, transforming Scala-specific features into constructs understandable by the JVM.
    For instance, higher-order functions, tail-recursive functions, and case classes are represented in a form compatible with JVM bytecode.
```

### 8. Emitting JVM Bytecode: Bytecode -> .class Files

```
    The JVM bytecode is saved into .class files, each corresponding to a Scala class, object, or trait.
    These .class files can then be executed on the JVM or loaded into other JVM-compatible environments.
```
